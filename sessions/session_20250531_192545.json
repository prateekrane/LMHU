        "content": "Global warming refers to the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.",

        "title": "The Greenhouse Effect",
        "content": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. Absorbed energy warms the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth. Human activities are increasing the concentration of these gases, leading to enhanced warming.",
