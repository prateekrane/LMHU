        "title": "What is Global Warming?",
        "content": "Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature. It is primarily caused by human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the planet to warm. The consequences are far-reaching, impacting weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems.",

        "title": "The Greenhouse Effect",
        "content": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When solar energy reaches our planet, some of it is absorbed and warms the Earth, and the rest is radiated back into space. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap some of this outgoing radiation, retaining heat in the atmosphere. Human activities are intensifying this effect, leading to global warming.",
