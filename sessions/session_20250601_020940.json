It allows developers to use their existing JavaScript knowledge to create cross-platform apps that run on both iOS and Android.  React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. Instead of building for the web, you are building directly for mobile devices from a single codebase. This section will cover the core concepts and advantages of using React Native.",
